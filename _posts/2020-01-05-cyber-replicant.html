Space. Darkness. A radio wave springs from within the dead husk of a moonbase, echoing into the void. The third moon of the planet Trinidad, orbiting a red giant light years away from the shattered remains of Earth. Once a fairly popular spaceport, only one man still calls it home. His signal sent, he stares out into the distant region of space where he heard a civilisation had flourished. The few chat boards which were still online in that region had lit up with talk about emissaries from a new republic. Whether it was true, he was fairly skeptical. These kinds of stories appear all too frequently in that forgotten graveyard of Man. Sending messages out into the uncharted void is no game. You never know who might pick up the signal. But what he ended up encountering out there, was more bizarre than anything he might have expected to find. Suddenly, a connection. Someone had beaten him, traced his address and established a direct connection to his system. Before he could do anything to react, a message flowed onto the screen:<br/>"God, is that you?"
